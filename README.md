## Contributing

Your feedback and contributions are welcome! Feel free to open any [discussions](https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SWEJobs.fyi/discussions) or [feature requests](https://github.com/kevinshen56714/SWEJobs.fyi/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md). Any pull requests would be greatly appreciated as well! See below for more details on how to run a local development server.

### Run local server

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the local development version.

You can start editing the pages by modifying the files under the `pages/` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

For local development, instead of fetching real data from Firebase, we use mock data from the `data/` directory.
